# Intro to React session 2 lecture

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Its is a simple blog style posts page used to demonstrate the basics of useState, prop types, basic event handlers and a broad intro to working with React in general.

## Setup
Clone down the repo, and `cd` and into the new directory. If you want to start from the same place as we did at the start of the lecture, simply run `npm i` then `npm start`

If you want to see the finished app as it was at the end of the session, you will need to checkout the `completed` branch on this repo. You can do that by running
```
git checkout -t origin/completed
```
which will pull down the completed branch to your local environment (you may have to run `npm i` to update the new dependencies)

## Finished app
